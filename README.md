Time Sheet VBA:
Was created for Reederei F. Laeisz as a tool to set Crew Members working hours reports in a single format.
Main Features:
- Author's own database format (encoded text file -> conversion the batch of timesheets to ZIP), which allowed to minimize satellite traffic between ship and Head Office;
- Excell interface (including popup menues) was replaced with program specific one in order to minimize user's mistakes;
- Built-in calendar of public and national (German, Russian and Kiribati) holidays;
- Automatic calculation of overtimes and other required data for Head Office and corresponding salary calculation, etc...
